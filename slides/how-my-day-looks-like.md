##  How my day looks like

* Come to the office, check emails, sometimes have breakfast in the office
* Code review
* 10:00 a.m. scrum
* Code on my own or with my "pair programmer"
* Scatterd meetings throughout the day with designers, develoeprs both locally and remotely
* I usually have lunch with developers from other teams
* WFH sometimes (usually on Friday)
* After work, I like to go to technology meetups
* During the weekend, I sometimes go to Hackathon (a hacking marathon)
